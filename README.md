# Open Railway Styles

Design a style for railways using OpenStreetMap data

## Background

Most maps favour only roads. We want to display railway information.

The three projects are:

* [Infra Viewers](https://openrail-playground.github.io/openrailwaystyle/infra_viewers.html)
* [European Train Spotter](https://openrail-playground.github.io/openrailwaystyle/european_train_spotter.html)
* [Openstreet Trainsformer](https://openrail-playground.github.io/openrailwaystyle/openstreet_trainsformer.html)

This project has been initiated during the [Hack4Rail 2025](https://hack4rail.event.sbb.ch/en/), a joint hackathon organised by the railway companies SBB, Ã–BB, and DB in partnership with the OpenRail Association.
